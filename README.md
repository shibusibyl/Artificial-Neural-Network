# Neural Network Implementation and Analysis

This project focuses on implementing a neural network using Python and associated libraries. It involves designing, training, and testing the neural network on a given dataset to analyze its performance and effectiveness. The project also provides insights into machine learning model evaluation and deployment strategies.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on running the project in a production environment.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software and how to install them:

Annaconda


To install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn


### Installing

https://clouds.eos.ubc.ca/~phil/docs/problem_solving/01-Orientation/01.03-Installing-Anaconda-on-Windows.html

End the setup process by confirming that all tests pass successfully.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

These tests validate the complete workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

python test_script.py


This script tests:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model initialization and training.
- Evaluation and metric calculations.

### And coding style tests

These tests ensure adherence to Python coding standards and conventions.

flake8 <project_directory>


This command checks for PEP 8 compliance and suggests fixes for coding style issues.

## Deployment

To deploy the model on a live system:

1. Train the model and save it:
python train.py --save_model


2. Use a web framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the model:
python app.py


3. Access the model's API endpoint via the browser or HTTP clients like Postman.
